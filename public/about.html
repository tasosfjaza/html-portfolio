<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am ANastasios Roupelas
  I’m a passionate Front-End Developer with a love for creating beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly websites. 
  With over 1 year of experience, I’ve worked on a wide range of projects, from simple landing pages to complex web applications.</p>

<p>My journey in web development began when I finally decided to change my career path from the industrial world to the IT world and enter a University to become a Front-End Developer.
  Since then, I’ve honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Angular.
   I’m always eager to learn new technologies and stay updated with the latest trends in web development.</p>

<p>I’ve had the privilege to work with [companies/clients], where I’ve been able to [briefly describe a major achievement or project]. 
  I pride myself on [mention a unique quality or approach, e.g., delivering pixel-perfect designs or optimizing for performance].

  When I’m not coding, you can find me [mention a hobby or interest], which keeps me balanced and inspired.
  
  I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to check out my portfolio and reach out if you’d like to work together!
